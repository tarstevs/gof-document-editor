### Glyph

An abstract class defined for all objects that can appear in a document structure. Its subclasses define both
primitive graphical elements (like characters and images) and structural elements (like rows and columns).

Glyph's have three basic responsibilities. They know...

* their children and parent
* how to draw themselves
* what space they occupy
